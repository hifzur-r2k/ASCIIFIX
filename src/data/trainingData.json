Having thus prepared the apparatus, I placed the retort in a furnace, and kept the mercury at a heat little inferior to its boiling point for twelve days successively, carefully observing what took place. During the first day nothing remarkable happened; the mercury, though very hot, did not suffer any apparent change, and remained in its fluid state, without the volume of air in the recipient being diminished. On the second day, small red particles began to appear on the surface of the mercury, which, during the four or five following days, gradually increased in number and size; after which they ceased to increase, and remained in the same state.",

The volume of air in the receiver BC, which, at the beginning of the experiment, was about 50 cubical inches, was found to be reduced to between 42 and 43 cubical inches; consequently it had lost about 1/6 of its volume. Afterwards, having collected all the red particles, formed during the operation, from the running mercury, I found these to amount to 45 grains. I was unable to reduce this red powder back again to running mercury, without addition; but when I mixed it with charcoal powder, and exposed it to a violent heat in a small retort, I recovered 41-1/2 grains of mercury in its running state, and 3-1/2 grains were dissipated and lost. From these experiments we learn, that, during the calcination of mercury, air is absorbed from the atmosphere; that the calx of mercury is heavier than mercury, in the proportion of the quantity of air absorbed; and that the mercury can be restored to its metallic state, by separating the air which had been combined with it during calcination.

I might have contented myself with relating the experiment upon mercury, but I judged proper to add the experiments upon iron and lead, to show that the same effects took place with different metals, though in unequal degrees. It results, from these experiments, that the respirable part of air, or oxygen, forms about one-fourth or one-fifth of the bulk of the atmosphere; that the remainder, or about four-fifths, consists of azotic gas, which is noxious to respiration, and incapable of supporting combustion; so that atmospheric air is not a simple element, as was long supposed, but a mixture of two gasses, oxygen and azote.",

The first method is tedious, and requires a great apparatus; the second is liable to errors, from the difficulty of procuring liver of sulphur in a proper state; but the third method, by means of phosphorus, is simple, expeditious, and sufficiently exact for most purposes.

Pure azotic gas is chiefly procured from the mineral alkali, or from that produced by art, which consists of azote combined with hydrogen. When nitric acid is poured upon this alkali, it combines with the hydrogen, and forms water, whilst the azote is set free. The water is formed during the effervescence, and the azote gas is expelled. I shall describe the particular method of performing this experiment, when I treat more fully of azote and its combinations.
