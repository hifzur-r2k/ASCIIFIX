This is the object of the new nomenclature, which has been adopted by the chemists of France, and which is now beginning to be received in other countries. This nomenclature is founded upon very simple principles.

Animals are suffocated in it in a few seconds; flame is immediately extinguished when plunged into it; and it has been found that its base enters as an ingredient into a number of mineral substances, and even into some from the animal and vegetable kingdoms. We have named this azote, from the Greek privative [Greek a], and [Greek zoê] vita, because it is fatal to such animals as are forced to breathe it alone. But we are by no means to conclude, from this circumstance, that this gas is of a poisonous nature; the injury results entirely from the privation of oxygen, which is necessary for supporting the function of respiration; so that azotic gas is rather hurtful in a negative than in a positive manner.

I trust I shall not be censured for introducing new terms. The necessity of them is obvious; and it would be impossible to preserve precision and perspicuity of language, without carefully distinguishing by proper names the objects of our consideration. In what follows, I shall show that the principle which combines with metals during calcination, and increases their weight, and which in this state of combination may be called the metallic calx, is neither more nor less than the purer, or more respirable, part of the air we breathe; and, consequently, that the augmentation of weight, so remarkable during the calcination of metals, proceeds from the immense quantity of this pure air that is fixed during the operation.",Human,High,First-person narrative, historical tone, nuanced phrasing, justification of terminology,The author uses a first-person perspective to justify his linguistic choices and explain etymologies.

This apparatus consists of a glass retort A, having its beak adapted to the tubulated recipient BC, half filled with water. Having introduced four ounces of pure mercury into the retort A, and having fitted on the recipient, I carefully marked the height of the water in the receiver BC; I likewise marked, upon the jar, the height of the air it contained, being about 50 cubical inches. Having thus prepared the apparatus, I placed the retort in a furnace, and kept the mercury at a heat little inferior to its boiling point for twelve days successively, carefully observing what took place. During the first day nothing remarkable happened; the mercury, though very hot, did not suffer any apparent change, and remained in its fluid state, without the volume of air in the recipient being diminished. On the second day, small red particles began to appear on the surface of the mercury, which, during the four or five following days, gradually increased in number and size; after which they ceased to increase, and remained in the same state.",Human,High,First-person narrative, descriptive procedural language, temporal markers,The  is a detailed, chronological account of an experiment written in the first person.

The volume of air in the receiver BC, which, at the beginning of the experiment, was about 50 cubical inches, was found to be reduced to between 42 and 43 cubical inches; consequently it had lost about 1/6 of its volume. Afterwards, having collected all the red particles, formed during the operation, from the running mercury, I found these to amount to 45 grains. I was unable to reduce this red powder back again to running mercury, without addition; but when I mixed it with charcoal powder, and exposed it to a violent heat in a small retort, I recovered 41-1/2 grains of mercury in its running state, and 3-1/2 grains were dissipated and lost. From these experiments we learn, that, during the calcination of mercury, air is absorbed from the atmosphere; that the calx of mercury is heavier than mercury, in the proportion of the quantity of air absorbed; and that the mercury can be restored to its metallic state, by separating the air which had been combined with it during calcination. But I was still to learn what had become of the part of the air absorbed in the experiment, and what peculiar species of air remained in the receiver.",Human,High,First-person narrative, analytical reasoning, transitional phrases,The passage continues the experimental narrative," then shifts to analysis and reasoning based on the results.

Having applied a proper degree of heat to the retort, the red powder was speedily reduced to running mercury, and, at the same time, an air was expelled, which increased the volume of that already contained in the receiver from 42 to about 50 inches, and which possessed the following remarkable properties A taper burned in this air with a dazzling splendour, charcoal threw out sparks, and consumed with astonishing rapidity, and all bodies combustible in common air were consumed in this with a brilliancy of flame that was almost insupportable to the eye. This species of air was discovered almost at the same time by Dr Priestley, Mr Scheele, and myself.

9182052,"Passage 61 The experiments detailed in the foregoing sections, prove that air is not a simple element, such as it was long believed to be, but that it is composed of two gasses or aeriform fluids of very different and even opposite qualities. As this important discovery is one of the foundations of the theory I have to unfold, and as it overturns the ancient doctrine of the elements, I thought it necessary to support it by the most convincing proofs. I might have contented myself with relating the experiment upon mercury, but I judged proper to add the experiments upon iron and lead, to show that the same effects took place with different metals, though in unequal degrees. It results, from these experiments, that the respirable part of air, or oxygen, forms about one-fourth or one-fifth of the bulk of the atmosphere; that the remainder, or about four-fifths, consists of azotic gas, which is noxious to respiration, and incapable of supporting combustion; so that atmospheric air is not a simple element, as was long supposed, but a mixture of two gasses, oxygen and azote.",Human,High,Argumentative structure, historical significance, methodological justification,The passage synthesizes previous experiments into a major conclusion.

9182053,"Passage 62 Since azotic gas constitutes the noxious part of the atmosphere, or rather that part which is unfit for respiration and combustion, and since it makes no change upon lime-water, nor is absorbed by it, we may readily determine its proportion in any given portion of atmospheric air. For this purpose, we may either diminish the oxygen by calcination of metals, as in the above recited experiments; or we may abstract it by means of liver of sulphur, which absorbs the oxygen, and leaves the azotic gas nearly pure; or, finally, we may employ phosphorus, which has a stronger affinity than almost any other substance with oxygen. The first method is tedious, and requires a great apparatus; the second is liable to errors, from the difficulty of procuring liver of sulphur in a proper state; but the third method, by means of phosphorus, is simple, expeditious, and sufficiently exact for most purposes. For this last species of experiment, we may employ the apparatus represented Plate III. Fig. 3.

Having then heated the point of an iron, made red hot in the fire, apply it to the outside of the glass, opposite to the phosphorus, so as to heat the phosphorus sufficiently for making it take fire. When the combustion is begun, it will continue of itself till the whole phosphorus is consumed. As the phosphorus burns, the white vapour which is formed is gradually absorbed by the water, and the air in the bell-glass is proportionally diminished. When the operation is finished, and the whole is become cold, it will be found that the volume of air is reduced about 1/5 part; and that which remains is pure azotic gas, unfit for respiration, combustion, or calcination.",Human,High,Instructional language, imperative mood, descriptive process,"The passage uses instructional language (""let it be introduced"," apply it"") to describe an experimental procedure.

9182055,"Passage 64 It is not possible to obtain azotic gas perfectly pure by any of these methods, because azote has a slight affinity with oxygen, especially when assisted by electric sparks, or any similar circumstances favourable to their union. It is not easy even to preserve azotic gas pure, when obtained, if it be long kept over water or mercury, because the oxygen gas which these liquids always contain in solution, gradually mixes with the azotic gas. Pure azotic gas is chiefly procured from the mineral alkali, or from that produced by art, which consists of azote combined with hydrogen. When nitric acid is poured upon this alkali, it combines with the hydrogen, and forms water, whilst the azote is set free. The water is formed during the effervescence, and the azote gas is expelled. I shall describe the particular method of performing this experiment, when I treat more fully of azote and its combinations.

The name of oxygen, which signifies generator of acids, describes one of its most characteristic properties; for it has been found by a number of very exact experiments, that this element is the constituent principle of most acids; I say most acids, because there are some, as the muriatic and fluoric acids, into the composition of which oxygen does not enter.

Matthias was now eighteen, and the difficulties which confronted him would have tried the mettle of the most experienced statesman. The treasury was empty, the royal authority was ignored by the greater nobles, and the land was scourged by the freebooters of all nations who had flocked to the standard of the great captain Jan Jiskra, and, under the name of the  Bohemian Brethren"," had occupied the northern counties.
